# Crash Course
# Chapter 8 - Functions
# Exercise 8-7. Album: Write a function called 
# make_album() that builds a dictionary describing 
# a music album. The function should take in an 
# artist name and an album title, and it should 
# return a dictionary containing these two pieces 
# of information. Use the function to make three 
# dictionaries representing different albums. 
# Print each return value to show that the 
# dictionaries are storing the album information 
# correctly.Use None to add an optional parameter 
# to make_album() that allows you to store the number 
# of songs on an album. If the calling line includes 
# a value for the number of songs, add that value to 
# the albumâ€™s dictionary. Make at least one new function 
# call that includes the number of songs on an album.
