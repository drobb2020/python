# Crash Course
# Chapter 8 - Functions
# Exercise 8-12. Sandwiches: Write a function 
# that accepts a list of items a person wants 
# on a sandwich. The function should have one 
# parameter that collects as many items as the 
# function call provides, and it should print 
# a summary of the sandwich thatâ€™s being ordered. 
# Call the function three times, using a different 
# number of arguments each time.
