# Crash Course
# Chapter 9 - Classes
# Exercise 9-1. Restaurant: 
# Make a class called Restaurant. 
# The __init__() method for Restaurant 
# should store two attributes: a restaurant_name 
# and a cuisine_type. Make a method called 
# describe_restaurant() that prints these two 
# pieces of information, and a method called 
# open_restaurant() that prints a message 
# indicating that the restaurant is open.
# Make an instance called restaurant from your class. 
# Print the two attributes individually, 
# and then call both methods.
# Exercise 9-2. Three Restaurants: 
# Start with your class from Exercise 9-1. 
# Create three different instances from the 
# class, and call describe_restaurant() 
# for each instance.
# Exercise 9-4. Number Served: 
# Start with your program from Exercise 9-1. 
# 1. Add an attribute called number_served with a default 
#    value of 0. Create an instance called restaurant from this 
#    class. Print the number of customers the restaurant has served, 
#    and then change this value and print it again. 
# 2. Add a method called set_number_served() that lets you set the 
#    number of customers that have been served. Call this method with 
#    a new number and print the value again.
# 3. Add a method called increment_number_served() that lets 
#    you increment the number of customers whoâ€™ve been served. Call this 
#    method with any number you like that could represent how many 
#    customers were served in, say, a day of business.
# Exercise 9-6. Ice Cream Stand: 
# An ice cream stand is a specific kind of restaurant. 
# 1. Write a class called IceCreamStand that inherits from the 
#    Restaurant class you wrote in Exercise 9-4. 
#    Add an attribute called flavors that stores a list of ice cream flavors. 
#    Write a method that displays these flavors. 
#    Create an instance of IceCreamStand, and call this method.
