# Crash Course
# Chapter 9 - Classes
# Exercise 9-3. Users: 
# Make a class called User. 
# Create two attributes called first_name and last_name, 
# and then create several other attributes that are 
# typically stored in a user profile. 
# Make a method called describe_user() 
# that prints a summary of the userâ€™s information. 
# Make another method called greet_user() that 
# prints a personalized greeting to the user.
