# Exercise 10.2 - Learning X (replace):
# You can use the replace() method to replace 
# any word in a string with a different word. 
# Hereâ€™s a quick example showing how to replace 
# 'dog' with 'cat' in a sentence:
# >> > message = "I really like dogs."
# >> > message.replace('dog', 'cat')
# 'I really like cats.'
# Read in each line from the file you just created, 
# learning_python.txt, and replace the word Python 
# with the name of another language, such as C. Print 
# each modified line to the screen.

filename = 'learning_python.txt'

with open(filename) as file_object:
    lines = file_object.readlines()

print("")
print("Print the contents from a list.")
for line in lines:
    line = line.rstrip()
    print(line.replace('python', 'bash'))
