# Crash Course
# Chapter 8 - Functions
# Exercise 8-10. Sending Messages: Start with 
# a copy of your program from Exercise 8-9. 
# Write a function called send_messages() 
# that prints each text message and moves 
# each message to a new list called sent_messages 
# as itâ€™s printed. After calling the function, 
# print both of your lists to make sure the 
# messages were moved correctly.
