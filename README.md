# Python Learning Repository

This is my learning repository while I teach myself python. Feel free to take what you want, but remember it is learning code and a work in progress.
The sources I'm using are all found on O'Reilly Learning:
1. Introduction to Python, by Jessica McKellar
2. Beginning Python, by William Fiset
3. Python Crash Course, by Eric Mattes

These are all excellent resources.
