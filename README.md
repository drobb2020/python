# Python Learning Repository

This is my learning repository while I teach myself python. Feel free to take what you want, but remember it is learning code and a work in progress.
The sources I'm using are all found on O'Reilly Learning:
1. Introduction to Python, By Jessica McKellar (Video)
2. Beginning Python, By William Fiset (Video)
3. Python Crash Course, By Eric Mattes (Book)
4. Automating the Boring Stuff with Python, By Al Sweigart (Book)
5. Python for Beginners: Learn Python Programming (Python 3), By Jason Cannon (Video)
6. Python for Unix and Linux System Administration, By Noah Gift, Jeremy M. Jones (Book)
7. Learning Python, By Mark Lutz (Hardcover book)
8. Socratica on YouTube
9. Tech with Tim on YouTube
10. Coret Schafer on YouTube
11. The Python Tutorial (https://docs.python.org/3.8/tutorial/index.html)


These are all excellent resources.
